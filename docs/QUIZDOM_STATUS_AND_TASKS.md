## 📊 Success Metrics

### By End of Day July 4, 2025:

- [ ] **Testing**: >80% code coverage, all E2E tests passing
- [ ] **Performance**: <200ms response time for all endpoints
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Graceful recovery from all error states
- [ ] **Documentation**: Updated README and inline docs

### Verification Checklist:
```bash
# All must pass by Friday 16:00
cd frontend && npm run lint          # ✅ No warnings
cd frontend && npm run type-check    # ✅ No errors
cd frontend && npm test              # ✅ All passing
cd frontend && npm run test:e2e      # ✅ All scenarios
cd backend && python -m pytest       # ✅ Still passing
```

## ⚠️ Risk Management

1. **TypeScript Migration Complexity**
   - Risk: More complex than estimated
   - Mitigation: Start early (Wednesday morning)
   - Backup: Extend to weekend if needed

2. **E2E Test Setup Time**
   - Risk: Framework setup takes too long
   - Mitigation: Use starter template
   - Backup: Focus on critical paths only

3. **Performance Regression**
   - Risk: Caching introduces bugs
   - Mitigation: Feature flag for cache
   - Backup: Deploy without cache initially
