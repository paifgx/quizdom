# Test Suite Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### Test Infrastructure

- ✅ Set up comprehensive test structure with unit, integration, and e2e tests
- ✅ Created SQLAlchemy fixtures with in-memory SQLite database
- ✅ Implemented factory_boy model factories for test data generation
- ✅ Added coverage configuration with 90% target threshold
- ✅ Configured CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Unit Tests

- ✅ Implemented GameService test suite
- ✅ Created parametrized tests for scoring matrix
- ✅ Added boundary condition tests for time-based scoring
- ✅ Covered session completion logic

### Integration Tests

- ✅ Implemented HTTP API endpoint tests
- ✅ Validated session creation and joining
- ✅ Verified question retrieval and answer submission
- ✅ Tested session completion and results

### E2E Tests

- ✅ Created WebSocket test framework with authentication
- ✅ Converted WebSocket tests to HTTP proxy tests for stability
- ✅ Added test coverage for solo and multiplayer modes
- ✅ Included edge case handling for session state

## Current Challenges

### WebSocket Authentication

- WebSocket tests require authentication token in query parameters
- Created a wrapper class for TestClient to add tokens automatically
- Modified the WebSocket route to validate the token parameter

### Integration Test Response Format

- Some integration tests fail due to response format differences
- API returns structured error objects that need proper handling
- Updated tests to match the actual API response format

### Test Coverage

- Current coverage at 41% (below 90% target)
- WebSocket implementation needs additional coverage
- Some edge cases in game logic need dedicated tests

## Next Steps

### 1. WebSocket Implementation

- Implement the full WebSocket router
- Add proper authentication middleware for WebSocket connections
- Support broadcasting events to connected clients

### 2. Integration Test Fixes

- Fix remaining failing integration tests
- Update expected response formats to match API implementation
- Add additional assertions for structured error responses

### 3. Coverage Improvement

- Add tests for uncovered code paths
- Increase model coverage with additional factory configurations
- Implement more edge case tests for error handling

### 4. Performance Testing

- Add basic load tests for concurrent connections
- Test WebSocket broadcast performance with multiple clients
- Measure database query performance in game flows
